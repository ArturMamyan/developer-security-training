# Security Training for Web Developers based on OWASP Juice Shop

In this training, the most critical risks in software applications are presented to teach web developers how to develop a secure web application.  
After introducing the Open Web Application Security Project Top 10 (OWASP Top 10), a selection of the application security risks listed in the OWASP Top 10 will be described step by step. Each security risk of the selection has its own folder with certain challenges to solve. In this challenges, the participants of the course have to find various security flaws in the OWASP Juice Shop, which is a intentionally vulnerable web application. The desciptions of the challenges include tips to help finding the right way of hacking the application. Always read at first only one tip, then try to solve the challenge. If you don't have a clue of going forward, then read the following tip.  
Also, each security risk contains a second folder with the solution of the challenges.

**IMPORTANT:** It is recommended to do the security training in the right order, as the challenges depend on each other.
