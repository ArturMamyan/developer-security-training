## Challenge 4.1: Log in with MC SafeSearch's original password (without SQL injection or changing password)

Log in with your own account or with the administrator's account (if you know his password or know how to perform SQL injection). Browse to the **admin section**:

Click on the eye icon next to the email `mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op`.
Open the console of the **Web Development Tool**. You see the **GET** call `http://localhost:3000/api/Users/8`. Expand this call and open the tab `Response` in there:

In the row `password`, the **MD5 hash** of the password is located: `b03f4b0ba8b458fa0acdc02cdb953bc8`
Convert this hash to plain text with a **MD5 decrypt website** like https://www.md5online.org/

You receive `Mr. N00dles` as password for **MC SafeSearch's account**.

### Additional information:

Now that you know the **GET** call for getting more user information, you have the opportunity to leak all user credentials. To do this, switch to the tab `Cookies` of the **GET** call.

Copy the token. You will need it for the authorization in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps).

Open **Postman**. Insert `http://localhost:3000/api/Users` as **GET** call. Change the `TYPE` to `Bearer Token` and paste the token that you have copied before. Click on `Send`:

As result, all users of the juice shop are listed with their stored information including their password hashes.
